# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Video

**Intro**

This is a website that allows a user to share photos of their experience around the US and have users like the photo. It has a title, profile info, and photo cards that are useful to display that idea. The technologies used to create this website are HTML, CSS, Figma, and GitBash. This website is also able to adjust to different screens, whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or a smaller mobile device.

I plan to improve the media queries and pixels to be more like the ones in Figma.

Note: I have not included the video since I want to make sure the website works properly first before recording.
